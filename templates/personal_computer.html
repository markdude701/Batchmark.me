<h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College is a campus spread across 854 acres in Erie, Pennsylvania. Penn State is part of the university ranked #1 based on a survey of business recruiters for producing graduates prepared to succeed. As of the Fall of 2016, the university has 5,050 students currently enrolled. To go along with the number of students, The Behrend College has a large number of employees. The university has nearly 700 employees, including more than 330 faculty members (At a Glance). The university has to accommodate this high number of technology users with A strong IT Staff and IT department as a whole. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Penn State IT department has a mission that states &ldquo;We work hard to make IT easy&rdquo; (ITS Services and Solutions). As Penn State continues to grow, the IT department will also look to grow. The growing number of students in the university will cause a strain on the technology which could lead to reduced technology life. This is something the IT team will need to look into, in order to be prepared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College Information Technology Services is facing many challenges, including hardware upgrades, software licensing availability, and security. Information technology staffing is a concern at The Behrend College. Members of the senior IT staff are retiring, and will not be replaced immediately (Alexander). Furthermore, cyber security is a growing challenge internationally, which greatly affects campus computers. The Behrend College Information Technology department authorizes the strategic plan. The need to implement new computers in universities every few years is significant. Improvements to technology, include hardware and software upgrades. Ensuring campus has up-to-date computer labs, will help the college to attract potential students. In order to be competitive with the technological advances, Penn State will have adjusted how often new technology is implemented. The following points outline the scope of Penn State, The Behrend College Computer Upgrade Strategic Plan, which includes the project idea, identifies who the project is helping, and specifies what the project requires in order to be completed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College is to replace outdated computer hardware from one of its current computer labs. Performing the repairs in the summer, will also prevent any interruptions during scheduled classes. It would also be in the best interest of the college, to update computer labs that require higher quality components. There are several courses that require components that can handle large amounts of stress. The concept of cloud storage is to be instituted to older computers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College plans to modernize education with the best technology available. Upgrades will provide greater productivity with new programs, when compared to previous versions. These upgrades will grant The Behrend College the ability to attract prospective students as well as create partnerships with major companies. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Penn State updates the hardware in their computer labs, the efficiency level of each computer lab will rise. Keeping hardware up-to-date is a key part of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">student&rsquo;s satisfaction. The students will be able to enjoy new state of the art technology, when the labs are updated with new software after the implementation of new hardware. As a result of the updated computer labs, students will have the ability to use technology that is extremely efficient, in turn, providing the opportunity to work on their studies in a more efficient manner. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges may arise during this upgrade period. The removal of computers interrupts class time. The deletion of data is time consuming and decreases staff&rsquo;s time to attend to work orders. The information technology staff will update computer labs more frequently. The prices of computers are rising. For each iteration of software packages, licenses need to be repurchased. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College will update the hardware, which includes accepting the arriving hardware, conducting driver research, physical installation, and MAC address harvesting. After the hardware is prepared, software is updated. The current Behrend Operating system will be installed to stay up-to-date with University Park. Next, the software is installed to the corresponding lab, and the printers are synced to a server. </span></p>

<h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College is a campus spread across 854 acres in Erie, Pennsylvania. Penn State is part of the university ranked #1 based on a survey of business recruiters for producing graduates prepared to succeed. As of the Fall of 2016, the university has 5,050 students currently enrolled. To go along with the number of students, The Behrend College has a large number of employees. The university has nearly 700 employees, including more than 330 faculty members (At a Glance). The university has to accommodate this high number of technology users with A strong IT Staff and IT department as a whole. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Penn State IT department has a mission that states &ldquo;We work hard to make IT easy&rdquo; (ITS Services and Solutions). As Penn State continues to grow, the IT department will also look to grow. The growing number of students in the university will cause a strain on the technology which could lead to reduced technology life. This is something the IT team will need to look into, in order to be prepared.</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College Information Technology Services is facing many challenges, including hardware upgrades, software licensing availability, and security.</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware and Software History</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardware must be able to support the curricula scheduled to be taught in the corresponding computer lab. Engineering labs need a powerful processor to handle advanced calculations (Chiappetta). A communication lab needs a higher resolution monitor, and a more powerful graphics card to design marketing material. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, software licensing is limited across campus. Adobe Creative Cloud programs are limited to a number of lab machines across campus, due to high licensing costs. When upgrading, parallel adoption, or adopting new technology without completely replacing the old technology in order to have something to fallback to, is best option. &ldquo;Moving towards a new system from a legacy system should be a disciplined evolution&hellip; you never know what kind of side effects the new system might create&rdquo; (Lee). Any issues with the cloud only software would have a backup in another lab with physical copies in order to deal with any unknown side effects or difficulties with transitions to new types of hardware or software.</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information technology staffing is a concern at The Behrend College. Members of the senior IT staff are retiring, and will not be replaced immediately (Alexander). Additional class hours will increase the computers use, resulting in less time for maintenance and upgrades (Newcomb). Also, the number of computers on campus is continuing to rise, increasing the ratio of computers to employees (Alexander). Therefore, staffing is an increasing problem at The Behrend College Information Technology services.</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, cyber security is a growing challenge internationally, which greatly affects campus computers. In addition to that, physical security of the computers is an issue. To combat theft or damage of the devices, the university has implemented security cameras in all twenty-four hour labs, along with door locks, monitor chain locks, security screws, and padlocks (Say).</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorization</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College Information Technology department authorizes the strategic plan. The upgrades come from the IT fee section of tuition. For this reason, it does not need to be cleared with Penn State University Main Campus (Alexander). In order to remain consistent, The Behrend College notifies University Park about the planned changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significance</span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to implement new computers in universities every few years is significant. Improvements to technology include hardware and software upgrades. Furthermore, universities compete to attract as many new students as possible. Students are attracted to state-of-the-art technology, while deciding what college to attend. Students live in a technology rich environment. In a report titled, The Future of Higher Education: How Technology Will Shape Learning, Marie Glenn stated, &ldquo;No generation is more at ease with online, collaborative technologies than today&rsquo;s young people&hellip;. Where a notebook and pen may have formed the tool kit of prior generations, today&rsquo;s students come to class armed with smart phones, laptops, and iPods&rdquo; (Glenn 7). Ensuring campus has up-to-date computer labs will help the college to attract potential students. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penn State has to focus on ensuring that students are satisfied with the technology on campus, as well as to accommodate for the teaching staff, due to how fast technology is evolving. In the report Future of Higher Ed, Glenn explained &ldquo;Technology is enabling multi-modal teaching, changing the curricula and spawning rich forms of online research and collaboration&hellip;&rdquo; (Glenn 8). In order to be competitive with the technological advances, Penn State will have adjusted how often new technology is implemented. </span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scope </span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following points outline the scope of The Penn State, The Behrend College Computer Upgrade Strategic Plan, which includes the project idea, identifies who the project is helping, and specifies what the project requires in order to be completed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the implementation of the three-year strategic plan, The Behrend College will create a higher standard of learning benefiting both its students and faculty, by planning on an increase of overall yearly cumulative GPA of 0.2. The GPA increase will be accomplished by updating outdated computer lab to match, or exceed, the technology level of current labs, replace the networking switch in the lab&rsquo;s wiring, and install new computers with HDMI 16:9 monitors, replacing the outdated 4:3 VGA monitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the increase in GPA, The Behrend College plans to create a more structured</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">environment for their Information Technology staff by reducing repairs and upgrades during class by 15%. The environment will be more stable, by creating schedules that are less strenuous and demanding on IT staff, performing less frequent computer and network repairs in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h1><strong>Goals </strong></h1>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware Analysis </span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Behrend College is to replace outdated computer hardware from one of its current computer labs. The primary purpose of replacing a whole lab is convenience. We plan to replace the computer towers before the fall semester starts, in order to eliminate any repairs, or orders, during the year. Performing the repairs in the summer, will also prevent any interruptions during scheduled classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also be in the best interest of the college to update computer labs that require higher quality components. There are several courses that require components that can handle large amounts of stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to recycle and continue the life of the towers, cloud storage and Microsoft&rsquo;s Remote Desktop will be instituted. Higher quality hardware would only have to be installed on server computers. This would not require the client-side computer to have updated hardware.</span></p>
<h2><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Analysis </span></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the outdated hardware is to be replaced, questions arise associated with software. Assuming that a program is still functional, it does not need to be purchased, and can be installed on the new machine. The Behrend College plans to have the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit deployed by the end of the summer semester. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this upgrade, it would be beneficial to update the software as well. With more demanding capable hardware, having updated software will be beneficial to the university. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h1><strong>Strategic Plan 2016-2017</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Goal One: Update Hardware by The End of Summer</strong></h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy One: Accept arrival Hardware</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Order hardware in the form of 25 new PC&rsquo;s early so that it can arrive one month before the summer installation period. Two additional of each hardware device is ordered so that spares can be kept. In the event of a failure, a spare hardware device can be swapped out while the warranty replacement is ordered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Maintenance accepts delivery of hardware as it is shipped from the manufacturer to the maintenance and operations receiving dock. Pallets of hardware are loaded by maintenance onto a maintenance box truck. Maintenance delivers the hardware to a temporary setup room, and removes the boxes from the pallets the same day they arrive on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Lock down a setup room after The Behrend College IT Services is notified new hardware has arrived from the manufacturer. A setup room is selected for maintenance to deliver the hardware. A nearby classroom is selected to store the new equipment. After moving any classes out of the room, it is locked down so that only IT and maintenance staff have access to the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Four</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unbox computers and sort the inventory of hardware components at a rate of 30 computers per hour (Newcomb). Unboxing and sorting the hardware allows for quicker installation of the devices when the lab is ready for upgrades.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy Two: Conduct Driver Research</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Deliver a new PC to the IT Support Specialist. After unboxing a new model PC the academic technician will deliver one PC to the IT Support Specialists office. This is done at the end of the first day of unboxing when the academic technician is returning to the Hammermill building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Conduct research of drivers by checking the manufacturer's website. The drivers are downloaded and extracted if they were downloaded in a compressed state. This process would typically take thirty minutes, and would be conducted by the IT support specialist (Newcomb).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Configure Remote Installation Service conducted by the systems administrator. The systems administrator adds the drivers to the remote installation service so that the drivers can be used with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Four</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Test installed drivers, and if testing fails, the process is repeated until successfully complete. This process can take up to 24 hours to correct and usually takes several attempts to perfect (Newcomb).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy Three: Install Computers</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Lock down the computer lab being upgraded. The computer lab will be closed to students and faculty for up to a week to perform upgrades and must be ready for student use at the end of the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Gather additional IT staff group composed of four to seven members to assist in the installation process. Multiple IT support specialists, student consultants, the student academic technician, and the manager of IT support services will all assist in the installation of new computers into the lab (Say).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remove old equipment at a rate of seven computers per hour per person. Any equipment that can be reused will be left in place. Equipment that can be reused includes power cords, power strips, electrical extension cords, and network cables (Newcomb).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Four</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Clean the computer lab. Garbage is removed from inside the tables. The table tops are dusted, and the tower slings are vacuumed out. Any stained chairs are cleaned with carpet cleaner. This cleaning is performed at a rate of 30 workstations per hour (Newcomb).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy Four: Harvest MAC Addresses and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Reservation</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Assemble new Computers at a rate of five per person per hour. This includes setup time for a new monitor, PC, keyboard, and mouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Configure the computer's Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) settings. An administrative BIOS password is set so that the PC&rsquo;s operating system can not be removed without the password. The BIOS is configured so the PC will automatically turn on after a power loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Record and Organize Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses from each PC. They are recorded in excel and emailed to a systems administrator. This step is conducted at the same time as action two, and the combined process is completed at a rate of 30 PC&rsquo;s per hour (Say).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Four</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Create a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) reservation using each PC&rsquo;s MAC address. The administrator assigns a PC Name and static Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are provided within a few hours. Once an an IP address is received, software can be installed onto the device's hard drive using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Remote Installation Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Goal Two: Update Software Before The Week's End</strong></h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy One: Stay up-to-date with University Park on what windows system is being installed during new implementation</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Action One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Send one inquiring email to University Park relating to operating system</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Login to the Microsoft Deployment toolkit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Install software on 25 computers using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Four</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Configure Windows Update to automatically install updates every day at 3:00 A.M.</span></p>
