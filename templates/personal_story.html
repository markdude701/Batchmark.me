<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of people around me, my phone is dead, and I want to go home. Surrounded by so many drunken idiots, I stay close to my friends, because the thought of hanging out with them sounded much better than going to this &ldquo;Party&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this what the cool college kids are doing now-a-days? Do people, my age, actually find this entertaining? Granted, I am older than most of the kids that go to school here. But, I never really had a drunken, &ldquo;LET&rsquo;S GET WILD&rdquo; phase of college, like most kids, I believe, do. I would love to see an actual metric percentage of the number of kids who don&rsquo;t take part in the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; versus the ones who do. Is there a college stereotype there? I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you, because I don&rsquo;t really fall into it. But let&rsquo;s be real here, there may, or may have not, been times where I might have thrown up six times in a random bathroom at University Park, Pennsylvania during Halloween time. After that experience, I realized alcohol was not my cup of tea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still go to a few of the parties, that my friends are interested in going to, but for the most part, I really hate parties. I have had fun at some parties, but most of the time, you show up, you walk through many groups of sweaty, hot, hormones-infused late-teenagers, usually to an even warmer part of the house, where the drinks are located. I am friends with most of the hosts, so getting a drink isn&rsquo;t a problem. I look around, at the dark room, filled of young women and disgusting, or &ldquo;redneck&rdquo; guys, all appear &nbsp;to be looking to be several years younger than I am, with the exception of the hosts and a few of my friends. Some part of me misses the moment when I was just a nobody there, and I was a young hooligan, just hanging out. Now, as time is going by, I realize how much of a fad this is. I realize that people, this age, tend to just get drunk with their friends and party because that is what everyone is doing. As I continue to look around the room, to verify my judgement, the expressions that are one everyone&rsquo;s face is like going to see an M. Knight. Shyamalan movie and expecting it to be good. Everyone is looking like they are trying to enjoy it, but really, we&rsquo;re all dying inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that made a turn for the worst, but really. Everyone looks like they are having fun, but are we really? My three friends and I take a look around, and converse with the few remaining people that we know. We talk about usual the usual college garbage, such as &ldquo;How&rsquo;s class&rdquo;, &ldquo;How is &hellip;.&rdquo;, you get the picture. I don&rsquo;t really say much, being that I don&rsquo;t try to participate in the mindlessness, but I still say Hi and move on. I just want to walk home. I live around the block, and it is less than a two minute walk. I just want to go home, and relax in my moderately temperate house with these attractive girls I brought to this party. But, we stand around and continue to talk about classes and that stuff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a minute, the friends we were talking to leave, and our group continues to stand in place. We weren&rsquo;t the only group there, the house was filled with drunken, gross people, but standing in a group, out of the way, seems to work. I look around at all the people, and notice some of them looking back. I continue talking to my friends and just ignore the people I made eye contact with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after some time, we&rsquo;re just standing there, trying to figure out what to do. I am just bored out of my mind; this place is a toilet. During the inception of that thought, a kid, around eighteen or so, comes stumbling up the stairs, and goes towards where we were standing. WIthout hesitation, this kid throws up on the ground, on my shoes, and on a girls leg and shoes. I&rsquo;ve never met her before but she looked a bit more frustrated than I am. She starts freaking out on him, in a very unexpected manner. She pulled him by the arm, towards the outside door, and continues to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna kick your ass&rdquo;. As you would expect, my friends and I tried to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we got to the door, one of the host stops us and says that there are too many people outside, and everyone should stay inside. My friends and I are befuddled, with how to respond. We go aside and talk about our plans. The doorman said we can&rsquo;t go outside unless we&rsquo;re leaving. I gave them an alternative to hang out at my place, down the block, and they thought it would be nice &nbsp;to, at least, get outside for a little bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We go to the doorman, one of my older friends, and tell him we&rsquo;re walking back to my place. We walk outside, through the groups of cigarette smoking college students, say goodbye to some of our friends, and continue to my place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome. </span></p></p>
