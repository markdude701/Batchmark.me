<p><br />None of the actions told in this story are based on real events.</p>
<p><br /> I got a text from Jay saying he was on his way while Samantha and I were smoking a cigarette outside. We didn&rsquo;t get too see each other as much as I would have liked to. We both have crazy schedules, and I just wanted to have some quality time with while we have a break. <br />We stood outside for a couple more minutes, to finish our cancer sticks, when Jay walked up the deck stairs of our house. <br /> We went into our living room. He was wearing torn jeans, a pair that I&rsquo;ve seen him wear in high school (Yeah, I remember that stuff), a Jimi Hendrix tee-shirt, and flannel on top of that. Then on top of his head, a grey fisherman&rsquo;s visor, like what Bill Murray wears in Caddyshack, and a small, black backpack. <br /> We banter on about the normal things; small talk before the business goes down. We all sat on the couches. Jay, grabbing his backpack, takes a seat farthest away from us. He moves the coffee table over towards himself, pulls out a vacuum-sealed bag out of his backpack, containing some green and his scale, and he asked us what we want.<br />We told him &ldquo;The Usual&rdquo; and he started to weigh it out. <br /> &ldquo;You guys get the usual pretty often&rdquo; he remarked. <br /> &ldquo;I mean, what do you expect?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t smoke too often and just want to relax and enjoy the little things in life, you know. We don&rsquo;t need anything more.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;I understand what you mean. Have you guys tried anything else?&rdquo; He questioned.<br /> Sam and I look at each other and think about what he said to us. Sam and I like to take LSD from time to time to release some tension and find the meaning of consciousness, which is surprisingly more fun than it sounds. But nothing else too crazy.<br /> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both taken acid a few times. I&rsquo;ve also done coke a few times; I don&rsquo;t understand the appeal of those harder drugs, &rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;You see on the news about people ruining their life in drugs like meth, coke, crack, and all of that crazy shit.&rdquo; Sam agrees too. <br /> &ldquo;Broski. I totally understand how you&rsquo;re feeling. But, maybe, I could think of something else that would interest you?&rdquo; He pulls out a small, orange pill bottle, and opens the top. <br /> &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re pulling out heroin or some shit, am I right?&rdquo; I asked. <br /> &ldquo;Or some shit, bro,&rdquo; he assured me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; <br /> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right I&rsquo;ll worry about it,&rdquo; I looked at Sam, but she&rsquo;s too busy playing a game with her phone, playing Candy Crush, or something like that. She was one of those people that actually played games on their phone, to waste time, instead of indulging in social networking. She was really quiet, and enjoyed having her own time, and I admired her for that. She was one remarkable gal, if I had to say so. <br /> &ldquo;Chill bro. Feast your eyes on dimethyltryptamine. Also known as the experience drug. One trip you won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; He profoundly told us, with an excited look in his eyes. <br /> &ldquo;So, I know you&rsquo;re trying to sound fancy with what it&rsquo;s actually called, but does it have a street name I would know it by?&rdquo; I asked.<br /> &ldquo;I guess, most people would also know it by the name of DMT&rdquo; he responded, pulling out his phone, going through his pictures. Jay shows me a picture of a little test tube, some liquid that was a funky color, a guide to colors, and the same stuff he has in his container. At least, according to this picture, this wasn&rsquo;t fake or laced with anything. <br /> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a test kit, if you couldn&rsquo;t tell. That&rsquo;s real shit, yo.&rdquo; He declared, taking his phone back. &ldquo;Have you guys ever tried it? It&rsquo;s pretty fun.&rdquo; <br /> In college, I had a friend named Omar, who told me about how he did DMT with his girlfriend several years ago. I remember him saying that it was just fifteen minutes that lasted a lifetime. Their bodies melded together, like two forms of energy, floating through space, and they lived their lives together. And then, they woke up. Everything was normal, and they had wonderful sex after. I always thought he was kind of full of himself, but is another story. But, it sounded like fun. <br /> &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t tried it. Have you?&rdquo; I asked Sam. She looked up from her phone to join in the conversation, most likely due to getting bored after being unable to beat level 91 in Candy Crush.<br /> &ldquo;P&rsquo;sst.. Nah.. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to try it though. It seems fun.&rdquo; She responded. <br /> &ldquo;Being that it&rsquo;s your first time, do you guys want to try it?&rdquo; Jay asked Samantha and I. <br /> &ldquo;Right now? We have people coming over&rdquo; Samantha and I look at each other. <br /> &ldquo;Let me shed some light, for you. The entire experience only lasts about fifteen to twenty minutes, at most. You will be back before you can think of anything else. I recommend you take four hits, for the best experience. But that is up to you.&rdquo; Jay reassuring both of us. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just see what we can do&rdquo; <br /> Jay pulls out a short, glass straight pipe without a second thought. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was dirty, but it was definitely used. And it&rsquo;s the first time I have seen one of those glass doo-hickies before. <br /> &ldquo;What do we owe you?&rdquo; I ask.<br /> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about paying me. It&rsquo;s your first time and that&rsquo;s important. I want to be the one to take your crazy, hallucinogenic virginity.&rdquo; He joked, with great pleasure in his voice and a smile on his face. Jay seemed so happy we were doing this. <br /> Samantha put her phone flat-down on the coffee table. She looked excited, and she was happy to be doing it with me. She was grinning, ear to ear, and holding my hand. I was happy to be with her, in general. <br /> &ldquo;Our other guests won&rsquo;t be here for another hour or two. It&rsquo;s up to you, babe&rdquo; Samantha said. <br /> Jay heated up his pipe, and handed it to me. &ldquo;Take it like a normal breath and hold it as long as you can. I promise it won&rsquo;t be too different from acid.&rdquo; I did exactly that. I coughed when I breathed it out. He heated it again and did the same for Samantha. She only coughed once.<br />This is the point where it is so impossibly difficult to explain my feelings. Samantha and I looked at each other, and she smiles.<br />&ldquo;This shit is heavy&rdquo; Sam mentioned. At the same time, as cliched as that sounds, she was right. I felt the Earth&rsquo;s gravity started to increase, as it pulled me towards the center of the Earth. I looked down at my feet and everything seems normal. My field of view has changed a little bit. I look at more of the room, and less of the room simultaneously, somehow. <br />Jay heated the pipe again and handed me it. &ldquo;Round two. Time to get to the tunnel&rdquo; <br />I had no idea what that meant, but I grabbed the pipe and did my thing. I gave it back to Jay, and continued to hold it until he was finished heating Samantha&rsquo;s round. She took her turn, and then laid back into the couch. We both took a sighing breath, and just let the serotonin run wild within us. <br />Colors were beginning to change. Everything was quieter, and louder, at the same time. I noticed that space between noises, rather than the noises themselves. I heard a faint ringing in the back of my mind. I knew this little noise didn&rsquo;t exist outside my head. <br />I looked at Samantha and the color of her skin, and hair, seemed to exceed their borders. Colors and textures were leaking out of their boundaries, and pouring into the surrounding area. <br />She remains still, staring at ceiling, only blinking a handful of time since we started. The texture of the carpet starts to spin, and then spins the other direction. The texture on the ceiling starts to form into glowing stars and a night sky. <br />The dark colored framing around the room started to dance, due to their contrast to the white walls and ceiling. I see fractal patterns on Samantha, and she looked at me. It&rsquo;s odd seeing new patterns on something you are so familiar with. The borders of everything, I look at around the room, seem more jagged and yet symmetrical. Everything was uniform, and nonuniform; everything I could see was moving in grid-like patterns. The lights have also dimmed creating a haze that covered the room, and that made everything darker, but somehow more clear. <br />I gripped the side of the wrap-around couch, feeling the seams, where the two corners of the fabric meet. I&rsquo;ve done this motion before wasting time when I&rsquo;m bored, but the couch felt completely different. In return, I saw every movement the couch did in reaction to my fondling. <br />By the time I understand what is going on, Jay handed me the pipe, ready to go again. <br /> At this current moment, it has only been a minute or so since this experience started, and my arms are feeling heavy. I strained to pick up the pipe, but I&rsquo;m able to pull, while Jay does the rest for me.<br /> &ldquo;Okayyyyyy. Round 30, ha ha.&rdquo; I responded without being able to completely control my mouth. Words are difficult right now. I can&rsquo;t speak very well, but I am able to make complex though in my head. The voice in my head, my internal dialog, my ego, my thoughts, became louder and louder. I heard my own voice without talking. <br />Jay gave Samantha the same and we both lay down together on the couch. We both took a deep breathe, and just relaxed for second. I was ready.<br />The walls of the room seem to disappear into a darkness. Bright patterns of light circled in the air where the walls once were. Gravity seems to be nonexistent at this point. My body seems weightless, floating on a cloud, flying through space.<br />The spiraling patterns get more intense and Samantha and I soar through the light portal that appeared in our living room, The patterns are rapidly moving, and more patterns are forming on top of the current ones. A photographic outline filter effect lays on top of everything in sight. Perfect and imperfect shapes are forming and not forming all at the same time. <br />We are flying through space and time at a million lightyears an hour, while sitting still in our living room. I&rsquo;m still able to see Samantha and Jay. Jay extends the pipe one last time. <br />He puts it to my mouth, and I start to fall asleep. Everything becomes dark. I don&rsquo;t know where I am. <br />&ldquo;Am I dead? Am I asleep? Am I dreaming?&rdquo; I questioned, with my loud inner thoughts still echoed within the chasms of my mind. &ldquo;Did Samantha come with me? I&rsquo;m so confused.&rdquo; <br />It felt like several minutes passed, and I started to regain my some vision. I started to see bright green, with red and white. This place was not my living room.<br />My vision comes back, and I am standing in the middle of a wheat field. Within the distance, I saw a small, red farmhouse, with a white fence surrounding the border, and a long drive-way reaching the house, originating from the horizon. I glanced around the wheat fields, stretching as far as the eye can see. I am on a hillside, leading to the farmhouse, and peaking at another hill across the far fields. <br />I looked at myself and see I am wearing similar clothing to what I was wearing before. I had a logo on my tee-shirt, but right now it looked fuzzy, like there was supposed to be a logo but instead a smudge of grey was printed.</p>
<p>The clouds were pink, with a slight purple glow, while the background of the sky was a soft orange and green matte color, with beautiful stars scattered throughout, making shapes in the sky. The moon was just appearing over the horizon as the sun was setting. The sun appeared to be both orange and green, without being either color. The colors kept changing, and lines appeared, striking the sun into pieces, adding yellow and purple variations. <br />I wasn&rsquo;t too sure where I was. I&rsquo;ve lost my partner in crime and I have to figure out what to do. I walked to the farmhouse, which appeared to be about a quarter mile away. Maybe I she was there.<br />That walk took a lot more time than I expected. Time seemed to slow down in this world.<br />The air was starting to get colder as the sun set. I reached the farmhouse and was greeted by the scent of freshly-cut grass. The farmhouse looked like something I have seen in photographs, but not in real life. I walk up to the door, and put my fist up to knock. The door opens and a man answers the door. He has a striking resemblance to my father, or my own face, as a matter of fact. His jawline drew a strong resemblance to my family, and I would not be able to forget that. <br />&ldquo;Welcome. I bet you have some questions.&rdquo; The gentleman greeted me, gesturing to come inside. &ldquo;Please, take a seat, and relax.&rdquo; I did what he said without hesitation. He is the only other person around here, and he is my best bet to find some information.<br />&ldquo;I am Felix the farmer and the first step to your journey&rdquo; he started with. &ldquo;I understand you may have many questions. I am here to answer anything you need answered.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;To begin, where the hell am I? Where did Samantha go and how long have I been here?&rdquo; I asked. <br />&ldquo;You took dimethyltryptamine, or DMT. After a certain amount, you fall into a dream-state of consciousness. Your mind creates a world where your memories, connections, and feelings are set free to create what they please. Some people believe this is the last place you see before you pass away. For the lack of better term, this is your world. You can manipulate and play with this world as you please, if you please&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying I can make shit happen with my mind?&rdquo; I asked with greater interest.<br />&ldquo;That is really all up to you. You are your own limitation.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Where is Samantha? You never answered that one.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Ah, I see. Quick perception, I see. Samantha is just fine. The only unfortunate part is that she did not get take the last hit, like you did. Her mind put her into the tunnel of patterns and stars, and she is now flying in the stars above us. I know that may seem like a disappointing answer, but there may be a solution.&rdquo; He took a moment to clear his throat. &ldquo;You have to find how to connect with space, and you will be reunited with your fiance.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;That is such a vague answer. Can you help me out anymore than that?&rdquo; I responded.<br />&ldquo;Daniel, this is your world. You can make your own decisions. You can find Samantha, or you don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to. She will be laying right there after this journey. It&rsquo;s just up to you, how you want to spend your time here. Do you want to find Samantha, create a new element, conquer North Korea, or climb the Empire State building with your own hands. Just enjoy your time and try to make the most of it. Once you find a purpose, you will wake up so try to use your time wisely.&rdquo; Felix said.<br />&ldquo;What do you mean by purpose? Anything can be a purpose?&rdquo; I quizzically asked. <br />&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re starting to understand what I&rsquo;m getting at. Now, go. Enjoy your time exploring the inner machinations of your mind.&rdquo; <br />I stood up, and thanked him for his time.I shake his hand and walk outside. I wanted to explore this land, and see what kind of fun I could have. <br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark in here&rdquo; I think to myself. I raise both of hands, in front of me, with my palms facing the open sky. I think for a second, and flick my wrists.<br />In the sky, appears a pink, cube-shaped like sun with defined borders appears in the sky between my hands emitting a pink glow and a small neon hum that resounded throughout the valley. <br />&ldquo;Woah,&rdquo; I put my hands down and look at them. I take a moment to appreciate what happened. I snap my right hand and the sun I created turned black with white outlines. <br /> The fields were now covered with moonlight, from the fake, drug-induced sun in my head. Cool. <br />I shut my eyes for a second, and imagine myself sitting in the the redwood forest, on top of a mountain, overlooking all of the trees. After I opened my eyes, I was on top of a mountain in the redwood forest. The trees in front of me were low enough to allow me to look over the seemingly endless mass of forest green, with blocks of dark green and orange mixed in. <br />The trees were moving and shaking freely. Every texture was moving in rhythmic and contrasting patterns. The massive redwoods uniformly were swaying without wind. There is a rock next to me giving me a place to sit and enjoy the view. <br />&ldquo;What am I supposed to do?&rdquo; I asked myself.<br />&ldquo;What do you think you have to do?&rdquo; My thoughts responded. The voice startled me; I forgot that there was, pretty much, another person inside of me. <br />&ldquo;Well, I really need to see Samantha again. I was hoping this would be an experience for both of us, but I&rsquo;m alone&rdquo; I stared into the dark sky, as the clouds were starting to clear, revealing the seemingly limitless constellations comprising the night&rsquo;s sky. My mind adds color, in some locations of the sky, making the cloud patterns more vivid and some stars into the shape of an elephant, Samantha&rsquo;s favorite animal.<br />I glanced into the sky, and imagine myself on a mountain top, in the middle of the Himalayas, surrounded by snow-capped mountains light by star and moonlight. Then, there I was. <br />I was able to create the world that I wanted to create. <br />&ldquo;Was that my purpose? There has to be a bigger meaning to all of this.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You keep asking yourself the same damn questions without doing anything about it. What do you want to have as your purpose? What is your meaning? What can you do? &ldquo; <br />&ldquo;In this world, I have the ability to create, and make it as I wish. There are so many options with unfathomable power. &ldquo; <br />&ldquo;What did you always want to do in your normal life that you couldn&rsquo;t do before? My thoughts questioned. Now it seems like their questions and answers are becoming more specific.<br />&ldquo;I want to have a purpose. I want to be something. I want to be important.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Then, make that happen.&rdquo; My thoughts responded, quietly, like someone whispering in your ear, on a cold December night in the Himalayan mountains; shivers down my neck resonated throughout the rest of my body, raising my hair follicules. The surrounding mountains seemed to raise along with them, with the sound of large masses of dirt and gravel rubbing against each other.<br />I looked at the patch of land I am standing on, surrounded by snow that covered a collection of fine dirt, grass, and leaves. The leaves do not make too much sense, but neither does anything else.<br />I raised my hands, and I thought about the mountain I am under. I waved my hand in a pickup motion, to see what I can do to the ground. I felt the mountain&rsquo;s energy as I grabbed the surrounding air. I did a pushing motion letting go of the ground&rsquo;s energy, stretched it for close to a mile in every direction and create a fields of flat, snowy, snow-lit land. <br />I waved my hands towards the ground ripped a small hole into the dirt, and wave my hand upward filling it with water. I looked into the distance, and think about something else to create. I thought about a beautiful house. One house comes to mind; the really nice house in the Himalayas in the Matrix movies, that I watched with Samantha two weeks ago would be great. <br />I attempted to conjure the memory of this location. I swung my arms all around me, letting off bits of energy, and hopefully not looking like a fool. The walls of the mansion started raising from the ground, The ceiling of the build forms and from the outside in and the house was complete. <br />I walked inside, and the rest was still forming. The walls have already appeared, the furniture was slowly materializing, and the stairs in the main hall were building themselves to the second floor. <br />I walked outside, and pointed my hand and motioned upward. Another house started to be constructed from the ground. I turned another way, raised both of my hands, and made the same motion; two more houses started to appear. I swung my hand, and create gravel pathways to these buildings. The gravel was definitely more noisier than the previous material. I kneel down to look at the material and notice that instead of gravel my mind decided to use grey Pop-Rocks instead. <br />I started to create more and more houses for this area. I created houses floating in the air, because why not. &ldquo;What else should be in our little city?&rdquo; I made some more houses, a bar, a few stores, a doctor&rsquo;s office, and other amenities. <br />&ldquo;But people. How do I do people?&rdquo; I pondered. <br />I waved my hands and hoped for the best. Handfuls of people started to appear, materializing from thin air. Each person seemed to be put in a random location but everyone was wearing what they should, and acting like they should, where they were. There were fancy looking people by the clothing store, finely dressed looking people in the nicer homes, and lesser looking people appeared in the lower quality homes. There were children playing, people standing outside of the bar having a good time, and a general sense of life that I created it. <br />I looked around my civilization, and wondered for what else there is for me to do. I did everything I wanted to do. I began to walk to the bar, MacCrimmon's Tavern. Yeah, my mind created the name. Whatever details I forget, my mind assimilates them into a proper image. <br />I saw an open stool at the bar, take a seat. I put my head down, and sigh. <br />&ldquo;What's the problem, big fella?&rdquo; Seated next to me is an interesting fellow. From the side, he looked like Jay. I raised my head to look at him. This person looked like Jay, but not exactly Jay. Whoever this is has way too much of an upbeat attitude. <br />&ldquo;I have to find my fiance. I did what I thought was interesting and fun at the time, creating my own world, and actually seeing my visions come to life. Playing was fun, but I think my purpose is to find Samantha.&rdquo; I said. <br />&ldquo;I think you got it, my man.&rdquo; Jay&rsquo;s doppleganger told me. <br />&ldquo;How do I do that? How do I become &ldquo;one with the stars&rdquo;, so to speak?&rdquo; i asked. <br />&ldquo;Do I really have to spell it out for you?&rdquo; My ego says.<br />&ldquo;You already created your path. Look all around you.&rdquo; Jay said, motioning to the rest of the room. The room was lively, filled of people, having fun, enjoying each other&rsquo;s company, and just living life. I did that. &ldquo;Now, you just have to find it.&rdquo; Jay told me, motioning to the door a few feet in front of me. <br />This mahogany stained pine door in front of me was my only obstacle to Samantha. <br />&ldquo;So this is it? She&rsquo;s in here?&rdquo; I said quizzically<br />&ldquo;I can only show you the path, you must open the door.&rdquo; Jay responded. <br />&ldquo;You know I always hated puns.&rdquo; We both have a laugh.<br />I put my hand on the doorknob and open the door, hoping to see Samantha&rsquo;s face once again. The entrance led to a small dirty and grassy area that had a path extending out over to a rocky ridge. I looked at Jay. He nodded and I continued to walk through the doorway, shutting it behind me. <br /> As I walk over the ridge, the pathway led to a flat desert, no floating anything. It looked like something right out of a Western movie. The clouds looked as textured and confusing as before, and the stars and moon were still fountaining green and orange light and onto the environment. <br />Along the pathway, I looked into the moonlit horizon and felt the cool cinnamon-smelling breeze coming up the ridge. This fire smelled way too good just to be wood. Once I finished traversing the ridge path, I saw a place that looks like a campsite. <br />I continued walking, and the pathway started to change material again. Instead of the material being something that made sense, the path became bunch of mini-marshmallows with cacao dust on top, looking like fluffy gravel, that was also edible, or at least looked edible. I&rsquo;m not saying that I would eat the ground, but if my inner thoughts didn&rsquo;t judge me, then I would be feasting right now. <br />&ldquo;Everything smells delicious. I think trying a bit wouldn&rsquo;t be too bad,&rdquo; I thought. <br />&ldquo;Chill out cowboy, there&rsquo;s gonna be more great stuff you&rsquo;ll wanna try.&rdquo; My thoughts stated. &ldquo;Just wait until you meet this man down here; you won&rsquo;t be disappointed&rdquo;<br />I walk down the path and eventually reach the campfire-looking place. There is a gentleman sitting there, next to an an open chair which looks like it is made out of graham crackers and Oreos. The logs in the fire were large cinnamon sticks.The cinnamon-smoke breeze makes more sense now. I don&rsquo;t know why everything seems to be based around food, but I&rsquo;m not complaining. <br /> Burning charcoals of cinnamon sit in the makeshift firepit, as the scented smoke rose up into the seemingly limitless night sky.<br /> &ldquo;Are you going to take a seat, my friend?&rdquo; The gentleman asked, startling me as I stared into the roaring cinnamon fire. <br /> &ldquo;Yeah, sure. I&rsquo;m sorry. This all is just so different for me. Where am I?&rdquo; I asked.<br /> &lsquo;You&rsquo;re in the Mellow Plains. Your mind decided to have you come to this place. Nothing to see for miles around, besides some &lsquo;shemllows and me. Now&rsquo;a&rsquo;days, I&rsquo;m the only one out here anymore. My name is Ole Charlie, in case you were wonderin&rsquo; &ldquo;<br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Daniel. I don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m doing or what anything of th&hellip;&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, my friend. I&rsquo;d be surprised if you knew what all of this meant. Whatever all of this is.&rdquo; Charlie said looking up into the sky. <br /> The sky still looked the same as before, a few clouds scattered in the sky showing the never-ending stars and covering the moon in cotton candy-like fluffiness. <br /> Charlie took the marshmallow he was roasting out of the fire, and makes a s&rsquo;more with the materials he had nearby. <br /> &ldquo;Try that, my friend. Betcha that is the best damn thing you&rsquo;ll have all day.&rdquo; Ole Charlie said, giggling to himself after. <br /> But let us be real for a second, that was the best s&rsquo;more I have ever had in my life. I could eat thousands, weigh a thousand pound, and still feel okay about having a diet consisting primarily of sugar. I engulfed that treat as fast, as I possibly could. <br /> &ldquo;You seem like you had a fun day, my friend. A lot of doing; lot of creating. So, what do you want to do?&rdquo; Ole Charlie asked me. <br /> &ldquo;I need to find Samantha somehow. I just want her next to be me again. We were supposed to be doing this together, but somehow we got separated&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;How do I become the stars? How do I connect with space?&rdquo; <br /> &ldquo;I think your thoughts may have been telling you all along.&rdquo; Charlie retorted. He motions his hand, and my graham cracker chair, turns into an, almost horizontal, reclining chair. &ldquo;Look into space, look for Samantha, find what you really want.&rdquo; <br /> I took a moment and thought about what he meant. The clouds in the sky were mostly cleared up, and everything was mostly lit by starlight of black, orange, green, and purple patterns. I take a deep breathe and imagine my soul in the stars, and floating through space being reunited with my loved one. <br /> I felt my legs getting lighter. The feeling of gravity seemed to lessen. I started to float above my chair, higher and higher through the air. Each second getting closer and closer to the sky and stars. I touched the clouds and try to grab some of the cotton-candy goodness but my ascension is too quick for me to grab onto anything. <br /> I got past the clouds and continue to look forward, towards the endless space and the large embodiment of stars. They started to move in a rhythmic fashion. My surroundings started to make patterns, moving in a uniform motion. The motion of the patterns increased and then started to fade away. <br /> The next thing I can remember is Jay&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;How was it, guys? Did you have fun?&rdquo; <br />I blinked a few times. My eyes were exceptionally dry, I must not have blinked during the entire experience. <br />It felt like this moment is the first time I have actually used my eyes in a century. The world as I used to remember comes back to me. I saw the glass pipe I used to get me where I currently am. Jay had a smile on his face. Dimethyltryptamine was an experience, and some part of me thinks about what my average life will turn out to be. <br />I looked around our living room, the same old house I have lived in for the last few months. Everything was as normal as it should be. Nothing was floating, colors appear as they should be, and nothing is made out of cinnamon or Pop-Rocks here. Jay was starting to pack up his stuff. <br />I turned my head a look at Samantha. She appeared to be blinking, breathing, and thinking about her experience. &ldquo;I just floated for days, in a sea of changing color, and spinning patterns. I don&rsquo;t understand the hype everyone gets around this. I had fun but it wasn&rsquo;t what I expected.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I expected. I enjoyed myself though. I don&rsquo;t really know how to explain what happened, but it was a journey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hey Dan, we should start getting ready. We are having people over soon. You&rsquo;re welcome to stay and hang out, Jay&rdquo; Samantha mentioned, as she started the clean the rest of the room. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually gonna head out in a sec. Just wanted to spread the love, you know&rdquo; Jay remarked. <br />&ldquo;Do you mind if we call off hanging out with the others for tonight? I hope it&rsquo;s no big deal, but I just want to spend time with you. I know it&rsquo;s been a bit. &rdquo; I asked her. Samantha&rsquo;s face lit up. <br />&ldquo;Yeah, that sounds great.&rdquo;</p></p>
